# 📞 Simple Dialer — Accessible Phone App for Older Adults

A **simple, accessible dialer app** built with **Kotlin + Jetpack Compose**, designed to help **older adults** and people with **low vision or motor difficulties** use their phone more easily.

This project started from a real personal need:  
After my grandpa bought a smartphone, he struggled with the default dialer — small buttons, cluttered UI, and complex interactions made calling difficult.  
So I decided to build a **clean, large, and easy-to-use dialer** focused on **simplicity and accessibility**.
